<h3>The Basics of Befunge-93</h3>
<p>Most likely the most unique element of Befunge-93 programming is the
   Program Counter (PC.) In almost all computer programming languages, the
   program counter is continually moving forward through the program,
   occassionally jumping to another spot in the code (but continuing
   forward thereafter, nonetheless.)
</p>
<p>The PC in Befunge-93, however, is subject to different rules. It may go
   <em>forward, backward, left, or right</em>. A Befunge-93 program is treated as
   an 80x25 torus (a page which wraps around on the edges) of ASCII text.
   Certain commands change the direction of the progress of the PC. By
   default, the PC points to the upper-left corner of the program, and is
   oriented to travel left-to-right.
</p>
<p>Each command in Befunge-93 is a single character, as is the largest data
   unit that can be specified in the program source; Befunge-93 programs
   have a maximum size of 80x25 total commands and data bytes. There are no
   run-time variables, only a single run-time stack. Befunge-93 programs
   allow for self-modification. Due to the 2-dimensional nature of the PC,
   they also allow for some extremely quirky code.
</p>

<h3>The Stack</h3>
<p>Something like Forth and PostScript, Befunge-93 supports a LIFO, Reverse
   Polish Notation (RPN or <em>postfix</em>) stack of signed long integers (that
   is, each cell of the stack can hold as much as a C language
   <code>signed long int</code> on the same platform.) The act of placing a value on
   the stack is called <em>pushing</em>, and the act of taking a value off the
   stack is called <em>popping</em>. The digits from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code> are valid
   Befunge-93 commands which push their respective values onto the stack. A
   double quote <code>"</code>, when encountered, toggles <em>stringmode</em>, and while
   stringmode is active, all character cells will have their ASCII value
   pushed onto the stack until another <code>"</code> is located.
</p>
<p>There are a few basic calculation commands:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     <code>+</code> addition
 </li>

 <li>
     <code>-</code> subtraction
 </li>

 <li>
     <code>/</code> integer division
 </li>

 <li>
     <code>*</code> multiplication
 </li>

 <li>
     <code>%</code> modulo
 </li>

 <li>
     <code>!</code> logical negation
 </li>
</ul>
<p>These are explained in greater detail in the Commands section.
</p>
<p>In order to push a number greater than 9 on the stack, calculations must
   be done with numbers less than or equal to 9. In any other language this
   would be a pain. In Befunge-93 it is a joy. For example, to push '123'
   onto the stack, one might push 9, then 9, then multiply (leaving 81),
   then push 7, then 6, then multiply (leaving 81 and 42,) then add
   (leaving 123.) In Befunge, this would look something like :
</p>
<pre><code>99*76*+
</code></pre><p>This is, of course, assuming that the PC starts at or before the first
   <code>9</code> and is working towards the right. If this snippet represents a
   entire Befunge-93 program, this assumption is correct: the PC starts at
   the upper-left of the torus and is initially oriented to execute
   rightward.
</p>
<p>NB. If the stack is be empty when you pop something off, be warned that
   this will <em>not</em> generate an underflow! It will simply push a 0 value
   onto the stack. Hope you can live with it!
</p>

<h3>The Program Counter in Detail</h3>
<p>There are 5 commands which unconditionally control the PC direction:
   <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>v</code>, <code>^</code>, and <code>?</code>. <code>&gt;</code> makes the PC travel to the right; <code>&lt;</code>
   to the left; <code>v</code> down; <code>^</code> up; and <code>?</code> in a <em>random</em> direction. So, the
   following example is an infinite loop:
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&lt;
</code></pre><p>As is:
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;v
^&lt;
</code></pre><p>As is:
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;v&gt;v
 &gt;^
^  &lt;
</code></pre><p>Note that <code></code> (space) is a null command which does nothing.
</p>
<p>Should the PC encounter the 'edge' of the program, such as if you were
   to try to execute:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;
</code></pre><p>The PC will 'wrap around' to the other 'edge' of the program. This
   example, then, is an infinite loop as well.
</p>

<h3>Decision Making</h3>
<p>The standard 'if' statement in Befunge-93 is either <code>_</code> or <code>|</code>,
   depending on how you want to branch. Both of these instructions pop a
   value off the stack and check to see if it is true (non-zero,) and
   change the direction of the PC accordingly:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     <code>_</code> acts like <code>&lt;</code> if the value is true or <code>&gt;</code> if it is false; and
 </li>

 <li>
     <code>|</code> acts like <code>^</code> if the value is true or <code>v</code> if it is false.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>'While' loops can be made by sticking an 'if' in an infinite loop. For
   example,
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;_@
</code></pre><p>(This program fragment pops all of the non-zero values off the stack,
   and the first zero value, then exits [<code>@</code> is the exit command.])
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> (ampersand) command will get a numeric value (in decimal) from
   the standard input and push it on the stack. <code>~</code> (tilde) will get the
   next ASCII character from standard input and push it on the stack.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<pre><code>&amp;,
</code></pre><p>...prints out "A" if the user types "65 ", and...
</p>
<pre><code>~.
</code></pre><p>...prints out "65 " if the user types "A".
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The <code>.</code> command will pop a value off the stack and output it as a
   decimal integer, followed by a space, somewhat like Forth. <code>,</code> will pop
   a value, interpret it as the ASCII value of a character, and output that
   character (not followed by a space.)
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<pre><code>665+*1-,
</code></pre><p>...prints out ASCII 65 ("A".), and...
</p>
<pre><code>665+*1-.
</code></pre><p>...prints out "65 ".
</p>

<h3>Special Commands</h3>
<p><code>#</code> is the 'bridge' command... it causes the next command which would
   normally be executed to be skipped over, and not executed. For example,
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;123...@
</code></pre><p>would output "3 2 1 ", but
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;123#...@
</code></pre><p>would output "3 2 " with one of the '.''s being skipped. Judicious use
   of <code>#</code> can make for very interesting code!
</p>
<p><code>:</code> is the duplication command. It makes a copy of the top element of
   the stack. This is useful, as demonstrated in the following program:
</p>
<pre><code>v.&lt;
&gt;:|
  @
</code></pre><p>This program makes duplicates of each value on the stack, which is
   checked, and if non-zero, printed.
</p>
<p><code>$</code> pops a value off the stack, but does nothing with it. So,
</p>
<pre><code>123.$.@
</code></pre><p>results in "3 1 ".
</p>
<p><code>\</code> swaps the top two elements of the stack. So,
</p>
<pre><code>123\...@
</code></pre><p>results in "2 3 1 ".
</p>
<p><code>`</code> (back-quote) is the 'greater-than' command. It compares the top
   two values on the stack, and returns '1' if the first is greater than
   the second. For example,
</p>
<pre><code>65`.
</code></pre><p>...outputs "1 " and...
</p>
<pre><code>25`.
</code></pre><p>...outputs "0 ".
</p>

<h3>Self-Modification</h3>
<p>The last two commands that need to be explained are the ones that allow
   you to examine and change the contents of the torus where the program is
   stored. This 'playfield' can be used for auxilliary storage when the
   stack alone will not suffice, but keep in mind that it also contains the
   running program.
</p>
<p>The <code>g</code> command examines the contents of the playfield. It pops a <em>y</em>
   coordinate off the stack, then an <em>x</em> coordinate. It pushes the value
   found at (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) onto the stack. If the thing at (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) is a
   Befunge-93 instruction, the value pushed will be the ASCII value of that
   character. From the point of view of the program text, <em>x</em> determines
   the column and <em>y</em> determines the row; (0, 0) refers to the first
   (leftmost) column and the first (topmost) row of the program source.
</p>
<p>The <code>p</code> command alters the contents of the playfield. It pops a <em>y</em>
   coordinate off the stack, then an <em>x</em> coordinate, and then a value. It
   places the value into the torus at (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>). If the program, at some
   later point, executes the instruction at (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>), it will be the
   interpreted as the Befunge instruction in the ASCII character set with
   the same value as was put there with the <code>p</code> instruction.
</p>
